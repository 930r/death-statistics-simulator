# death-statistics-simulator
I wrote this because I was interested in a statistic about how left-handed people die sooner and a debunking about why you should expect that statistic even when the null hypothesis is true, I wanted to see just how large the effect is when the null hypothesis is true so I can tell if that "debunking" is stupid or not
