# death-statistics-simulator
I wrote this because I was interested in a statistic about how left-handed people die sooner and a debunking about why you should expect that statistic even when the null hypothesis is true, I wanted to see just how large the effect is when the null hypothesis is true so I can tell if that "debunking" is stupid or not

outputs.7z is the compressed output i calculated, if you want to use it, i had to compress it because the output is 5153 times larger than the compressed file and github wouldnt let me upload that
