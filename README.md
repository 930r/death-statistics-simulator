# death-statistics-simulator
I wrote this because I was interested in a statistic about how left-handed people die sooner and a debunking about why you should expect that statistic even when the null hypothesis is true, I wanted to see just how large the effect is when the null hypothesis is true so I can tell if that "debunking" is stupid or not

outputs.7z is the compressed output i calculated, if you want to use it, i had to compress it because the output is 5153 times larger than the compressed file and github wouldnt let me upload that

statsbig.csv isn't used by the program but you can delete stats.csv and replace it with statsbig.csv if you want to also calculate projected values up until 2070

You could also make a file that doesnt just skip every 5 years so that when you look at the ages of ppl who died on a specific year, its not always just ages in increments of 5, if you do that make a pull request i guess
